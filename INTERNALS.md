```

The entrypoint for the devtools extension is the extension manifest. The
manifest for the Chrome browser can be found at
`src/shells/chrome/manifest.json`. The one for firefox at
`src/shells/firefox/manifest.json`.

Based on the manifest the browser then launches the
`src/shells/shared/background.ts` script as a background script
(`background-script` in the diagram above). There will only ever be one
`background-script` active per extension. Before the page is loaded
`src/shells/content-script.ts` will be injected. At the time of injection no DOM
(not even `<head>`) will be present. The content script injects the
`window.__PREACT_DEVTOOLS__` which the running Preact application will attach to
if there is any present.

If a Preact app attaches itself to `__PREACT_DEVTOOLS__` the `content-script`
will send an `init` event through `background.ts` to
`src/shells/shared/panel/panel.ts` which in turn will create the "Preact" tab in
the devtools ui. This panel hosts the extension UI.
